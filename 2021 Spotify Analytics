# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


#1. Find the artist/s with the most songs on the top 50 list
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) as count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT COUNT(*) as count
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    GROUP BY artist_name
    ORDER BY count DESC
    LIMIT 1
)

#2. Which artists have the highest average energy in their songs
SELECT artist_name, AVG(energy) as avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_energy DESC
LIMIT 5;
